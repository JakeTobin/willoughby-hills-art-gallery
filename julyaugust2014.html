              I have been working  exclusively in charcoal on paper since early 2002. The work produced during this  period is rendered in a realistic style with a focus on the effect of<br />
              light in conveying a  desired mood for a given drawing. In a land or cityscape, through various techniques  such as, for example, gradually building up layers of different charcoals of varying  temperatures, sometimes blended sometimes not, I find charcoal an effective medium in  creating mood via the effect of light.<br />
              It is my intent that  the overall mood of a piece will be experienced by the viewer in one glance: much in  the same way as I myself first experience, on site, the emotional impact of a subject.  The viewer may subsequently be drawn in to more closely examine<br />
              the drawing, where  upon specific details of the composition will emerge, further contributing<br />
              to the overall mood of  the piece.<br />
              I work from photos I  have taken myself on location, which is crucial to the work.<br />
              The photographs hold a  collection of memories associated with the direct experience of<br />
              a location, and  accurate documentation of the compositional elements of the scene. The<br />
              process of rendering a  drawing from photos I have taken thus becomes a sort of extended<br />
              moment of memory: the  finished piece, a personal memoir in charcoal.<br />
              Pieces appearing in  the July-August 2014 Willoughby Art Center exhibition were<br />
              done in the late  1990’s and early 2000’s: just prior to beginning work in charcoal.<br />
              Painted in an abstract  style, these oils depict landscapes in Normandy, France, where I<br />
              was living at the  time.<br />
          My work in charcoal is represented by  Forum Gallery, New York, NY.</p></th>

              Thanks to parents who loved to  travel I had a broad exposure both to cities filled<br />
              with artistic culture and pristine  wilderness. These two extremes I have always<br />
              found to be the most compelling  and intensely inspirational. Having grown up in<br />
              close proximity to NYC, about 30  miles down the coast in Matawan, NJ my first<br />
              inclinations were to explore city  life. I moved there to attend Parson’s School of<br />
              Design (now Parson’s The New  School) where I majored in Fine Arts with a minor<br />
              in Art Education. I made my home  there and started to do different types of<br />
              art related work, antique  furniture restoration, textile design, and custom shoe<br />
              making. All of the seemingly  diverse skills that I had been learning over the past<br />
              13 years seemed to culminate in a  decision to pursue decorative arts as a career.<br />
              In 2003 I moved to San Diego and  started my own business doing Decorative<br />
              Painting and Faux Finishing which  I have been doing for the past 11 years.<br />
              I met my husband Anthony, a  Cleveland native, while living in San Diego. We<br />
              would commiserate about how we  missed the seasons. On our first visit to Ohio<br />
              we drove east to Amish country and  I fell in love. These landscapes had a profound<br />
              effect on me. I realized I had  been living in cities for too long and had become<br />
              absolutely starved for nature, I  was craving a simpler way of life.<br />
              We decided to move in 2008 and  start life here. As we re-established ourselves<br />
              we took every opportunity to drive  out to these sacred places where the farms<br />
              are small and visibly hand (and  horse) crafted. I have taken thousands of photos<br />
              of these stark and serene settings  ever changing with the seasons. This past<br />
              year I have begun to explore what  exactly it is about these places that I am responding<br />
          to and have tried to express this feeling with paint.</p></th>

          <p>My goal in  drawing is to reveal something beautiful.   Colored Pencil allows me to move from extreme detail to simple  impressions and to travel anywhere in between.   I am inspired by geometric shapes in nature (i.e. the triangle of a pine  tree, the rectangle of a trimmed hedgerow).   Surprising colors in unexpected places open  my eyes and mind to new experimentation.   A little whimsy, a bit of graphic design and patterns of repeated shapes  are my standard tools for my recent Trees &amp; Clouds series.</p></th>

            <p>For me fine  art is like great music; it is based on the fundamentals and always “strikes a chord”  with the viewer.  From Rembrandt and  Puccini to the more recent Daniel Greene and Frank L. Weber, our hearts are  touched forever.</p>
          <p>Many people  tell me my art has a “soft quality.”   I  do try to treat all art subjects gently and perhaps this accounts for the  “softness.”  In oil portraiture I am  always looking for that special expression which will be definitive of each  personality.  Sadness, laughing eyes, a  sweet half smile, graceful gestures, and strong hands are all elements that are  exquisite to me.  Studying the geometry  of faces is interesting and one soon learns that every face has beauty.</p></th>
