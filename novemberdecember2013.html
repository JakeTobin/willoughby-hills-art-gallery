            <p align="left">Layne Kendig was born in York. Pennsylvania in<br />
              1938. As a boy he liked to draw flowers and trees.<br />
              His mother gave him his first oil painting set when<br />
              he was 9. He painted trees, flowers and still lifes<br />
              of fruit. He moved to Ohio in his early teens. As a<br />
              young adult, with family, there wasn’t any time for<br />
              artwork.<br />
              At the age off 55, he became interested in painting<br />
              again as therapy following a serious illness. Watercolor<br />
              painting has given him a zest for life as no other medium<br />
              has. His work is exhibited in many galleries in Northeastern<br />
              Ohio. His work has a quality of a fine draftsman<br />
              and his use of light and color show his individual<br />
              approach to watercolor.<br />
              He has taken watercolor workshops in Maine,<br />
              Pennsylvania, and Ohio, working with leading artists.<br />
              His love of painting has turned into a full time career<br />
              as an artist and instructor. He is an active member of<br />
              the Whiskey Painters of America and is also an associate<br />
              member of the Ohio Watercolor Society. He has won<br />
              numerous awards for his paintings and has been<br />
              featured in newspaper and magazine articles.<br />
              Recently his artwork was selected for the seasonal<br />
              holiday cards distributed by the Cleveland Sight Center.<br />
              Presently he is teaching watercolor classes at<br />
          Willoughby Hills City Hall, Willoughby Hills, Ohio</p></th>

              <p>Dr. M.H.  Phillip Chiang </p>
              <p>Dr. Phillip  Chiang began his artistic journey when he was in High School - Taipei,&nbsp; <br />
                Taiwan at  the age of 18. &nbsp;He captured  the essence of his former medical school&nbsp; <br />
                building  using beige's, browns and greens to highlight different aspects of this <br />
                prestigious  institution. </p>
              <p>It wasn't  until 2007, when he decided to get fully involved with watercolor <br />
                painting,  that his skills and talents as an artist took hold. &nbsp;He began his studies <br />
                in painting at  Lakeland Community College under the direction of Mrs. Joyce <br />
                Bennett.  &nbsp;Here, he developed skills of color mixing, perspective, and depth. <br />
                Through her  instructions, Dr Chiang began to develop his style of painting. </p>
              <p>In 2008, Dr.  Chiang happened to befriend an artist by the name of Layne Kendig&nbsp; <br />
                through the  acquaintance of a mutual friend. &nbsp;He began taking intense classes&nbsp; <br />
                with  well-known artist, Mr Kendig on a weekly basis. &nbsp;In so doing, he has  progressed <br />
                with great  strides in creating many beautiful images on canvas. &nbsp;Dr. Chiangs'&nbsp; <br />
                inspiration  comes from his love of painting and sharing stories of heightened&nbsp; <br />
                elation, as  well as, depths of sorrow with his mentor. </p>
              <p>Thank you, <br />

          <p>For as long as I can remember I have always enjoyed artistry. I started   in ceramics and from there made porcelain dolls. I then started   experimenting with creating drawings and paintings in many venues   including Acrylic, Oil, Pencil, Pastels, and finally one day about 13   years ago I decided to give Watercolor a try. I had found my niche! I am   thankful to Barney Cole and Layne Kendig for the endless hours of   support and knowledge they passed on to me. I especially thank God for   allowing me to recreate on paper what he, as the master Artist, has   already made. When I have a brush in my hand all the world and it's   problems seem to fade away. I am also a avid Gardener and find many of   my paintings right in my back yard. </p></th>

              Chaya Joan Richelson returned to the art world 2 years ago  after a 35 year hiatus. For almost 2 years, she has been under the tutelage of  Layne Kendig, and more recently, Barney Cole, to learn the essence of the  watercolor medium. She also attended a Fred Graff workshop. Her background  includes 4 years at the Cleveland Institute of Art, with her last year at the  California College of Arts and Crafts, majoring in Textile Design. In addition  to extensive gallery work in Berkeley, CA, she worked as a designer/painter for  a manufacturer of women’s hand-painted silk suits in San Francisco. Her designs  were popular on the east and west coasts in stores like Nordstrom’s, Saks Fifth  Avenue, and Macy’s.<br />
              “Today, I am very privileged to learn watercolor with such  esteemed artists. My current focus is to increase my control of the watercolor  medium while developing a strong sense of design, color, and composition. I  love the fresh, spontaneous look of a watercolor painting; the painting seems  so alive. Through watercolor, I hope to communicate with the viewer - to evoke  or create fond memories of precious moments in people’s lives. And, if people  of all ages find my work meaningful, than I have achieved my goal.”<br />
