            <p>My  subject matter is about the development of a story or a concept I observe from  life. Bringing life into a drawing with the vibration of color is exciting.  Seeing the viewer’s happy relationship to my work brings the most satisfaction. </p>
            <p>Watercolor  flowing on white watercolor paper is both exciting and challenging to control.  The application of bright, luminous, transparent colors allows light rays to  penetrate the paint layer. The light then bounces back off the paper or claybord  enriching the viewer’s vision capturing that moment in time. It is this  transparency of colors that make it difficult to reproduce. </p>

          <th colspan="2" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" scope="row"><p>I am an  expressionistic painter and every landscape, still life or figure that inspires  me to paint becomes a 3-d puzzle in my mind. Whether the color, shape or light  of an object was what drew my attention, a metamorphosis takes place. Mentally,  the subject matter becomes a shape first and an object second. It is simply a  resource for a creative adventure and collaboration of shapes. This is  accomplished through the use of exaggeration, elimination and editing. <br />
            I look at the  ground I am working on, whether paper or canvas, as the ground for a giant  puzzle. Multiple sketches start the process. Layers of tracing paper are act  one in this creative play. What works is kept, what doesn’t is torn off and  another sheet is placed on top, until it is a unified whole. . Where on the  picture plane should the main subject be? Do I create emphasis through size,  color, etc.? It is my job to give the work “good bones”. The challenge is  leading the viewer to the center of interest or, star of the show. It is a  “what if“ game of orchestration, combination and repetition. The shapes must  compliment rather than compete with each other. “Paintings are like children,  some are easier to raise than others”, according to Judy. Shifting and  re-arranging shapes continues until there is an intuitive Eureka moment. Only  then, will values and patterns that play well with others be chosen. <br />

          <th colspan="2" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" scope="row">Approached by  JudyThe subject is  frequently fractured or partially repeated to create a visual symphony. Often,  the composition takes as long to create as the work takes to paint. Each brush  stroke creates a domino effect and the painting itself tells you what to do.  “Think twice and paint once” is the game plan. Welcome to Judyland. <br />Anderson’s Bio<br />
Paintings reveal  a lot about the artist who did them. An exhibition of Judy Anderson’s work is a  visual conversation with an optimist. Canvases aglow with vibrant color and  strong design reveal a great deal about this outgoing expressionist. <br />
Interesting shapes  fuel Ms. Anderson’s desire to grab a brush and paint. Landscapes, still life’s  and figures all hold center stage in different works. Buildings accordian down  a hill, a festive still life does a table dance and figurative images celebrate  déjà vu moments. It is a variety show of subjects with color and distinctive  design elements telling the story. <br />
Born an only  child and raised in an older community, Judy’s love of art started at an early  age. Her playmates weren’t the neighborhood children but a pencil, a sketch  book and a cat named Shakespeare. An encouraging mom sent a drawing featuring  her feline to the children’s magazine <em>Highlights </em>and it was published.  She was seven at the time and her love of art grew as she did. the o
<p>Dance was  another passion in Judy Anderson’s childhood. The art museum and the dance  studio were her haunts. By the age of twelve, she was a seasoned performer.  Highly trained in the disciplines of ballet, acrobatics and tap, along with  art, a variety show of teachers/performers in both dance and art encouraged  this artist’s “out of the box” thinking. Her vivid, almost theatrical colors  and lyric fluid compositions are dances in paint. <br />
              The juggling act  between art and dance continued through high school. Upon graduation, she was  offered a dance opportunity in New York, where her art could also flourish.  Romance made the choice for her. Marrying her high school sweetheart, art now  took center stage and the desire for family and roots made Ohio her home. <br />
              The demands of  raising 3 children, a husband and a German shepherd did not put art on the back  burner. It made her adapt her medium to the circumstances. Intricate, fanciful  ink drawings were the expressive outlet when the family was very young. A few  moments could be stolen frequently during the day when all it took to stop was  the capping of a pen- no messy cleanup and minimum space needed for working. <br />
              A period of  developing and refining watercolor and acrylic followed; mediums she works in  today. Oil painting proved unfeasible as the artist developed an allergy to  turpentine and oils. <br />
              Drawing and  painting classes, along with workshops with different artists kept Judy  inspired and focused. Her art field expanded to include teaching, workshops,  and exhibitions. Encouraging individualism and creativity in students, clone  art was not an acceptable goal for either student or teacher. Hard work and  long hours on her own art brought a unique viewpoint and style to the fore.  Shows and competitions were entered on a regular basis and served as a gauge of  her own art growth.<br />
              When the  children were in high school her art took a different direction. Art visibility  at shows and competitions paid off. Opportunity knocked. The owner of a  commercial art studio in town became a fan and after numerous sit downs,  offered Judy a job as an illustrator. Untrained in the fields of air brush and  other commercial tools, she voiced concerns at the offer. Her future boss  explained that his other illustrators would teach her the disciplines lacked in  exchange for her unique style. It was a win-win situation for both. <br />
              Two years later,  an economic downturn had businesses cutting back on advertising and choosing  safer more traditional illustrating. Creatively frustrated, Ms. Anderson  resigned. While extremely grateful for the skills and challenges commercial art  afforded, it was no longer a match. It was a discovery period of what worked  for her as an artist. She did not fit in the commercial box and because of a  supportive husband, didn’t have to. A better, more focused artist emerged. <br />
              She and a group  of five other diverse professional painters formed a network for critiquing  each others work and sharing ideas. They met weekly to critique, encourage and  promote each other. They became “an art family” exploring “what if“ thinking  and analyzing why they made the choices they did. This creative think tank  strengthened both self-expectations and individualism for all. <br />
            </p>
            <p></p>
            wner of a small company, Judy started working part-time when her specific  illustration skills were needed. Working collaboratively with the writers in  the company, this again proved to be a training ground. Unhappy with the job a  writer had done, a client was ready to move to another agency. Judy asked for  the chance to write new copy and give it to him along with the illustration.  The company owner agreed. If the client didn’t like what he saw/read, the  company would happily bow out at no charge. What did he have to lose? The happy  client stayed with the company and Judy became a one stop shop for specific  customers. <br />
Part time meant  she filled the company’s needs while working on her own art. It was a good  arrangement and led to her writing a monthly art column for five years for a  news magazine. <br />
Commercial  ventures became unfeasible when her husband became ill. A stroke during an  operation left him paralyzed and Judy became his caregiver. Maintaining a sense  of self while improving her skills, Judy painted four to five hours each  evening after putting him to bed. She conducted art workshops and critiques in  her home and the weekly “art family” meetings became even more important. <br />
Having  fine-tuned her art to this point, it was time to seek gallery representation.  She approached Closson’s, the oldest art gallery west of the Alleghenies. Having  discovered Duveneck, Ruthven and Twachtman among others over the years,  Closson’s knowledge of art caused her to seek them out. It proved a good match.  She remained with the gallery until it closed. She is now represented by  Greenwich House Gallery in Cincinnati. <br />
Upon her beloved  husband’s death, Judy became immersed in her passion full-time. An intensive  art seminar out west, an art trip to Italy and a move to Columbus, Ohio  impacted both art and life. Still teaching, showing and judging in Cincinnati,  her base has expanded. Workshops , critiques and judging take her to different  parts of the state. She gained more exposure and a larger clientele. <br />
While Judy’s  paintings are influenced by subjects all around her, at home and away, they  serve as inspiration only. They are a resource, not a religion. Most paintings  are mindscapes, inspired by the shape of an object, a bold color or a  viewpoint. Angst is never portrayed. Judy believes “Paintings are like  children, some are easier to raise than others“. All require orchestration,  discipline and love to turn out well. Her goal: create works of art that evoke  a warm lasting response from the viewer“. Success was proven when a buyer,  responding to a smoke alarm in her home, grabbed one of Judy’s paintings as she  fled the building. Her emotional ties to the piece made it the most important  thing to save. Needless to say, this action created it’s own emotional response  in Judy. </th>
