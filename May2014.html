            <th height="26" rowspan="2" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" scope="row"><p>Jeffrey Jones is an established  professional photographer. He has an extensive history in design. His freelance  endeavors include interior design, wedding and event photography, and  industrial photography. He has been twice awarded Bride’s Choice Award for his  exceptional performance as a wedding photographer.</p>
              <p>His affinity for design and  aesthetic led him to formal training in Art and Design at Lakeland Community  College, from where he received his Associates Degree in Graphic Arts. </p>
              <p>Although he thoroughly enjoys his  work as an event photographer and feels a deep connection to preserving some of  life’s most cherished moments for his clients, Jeffrey’s true passion lies in  Artistic expression through photography. He feels that though the medium has  gone through a metamorphosis through technological development, it still has  the potential for true expression. Jeff believes in a minimal amount of  alteration to raw images in his artistic works. He feels that true expression  through photography remains a painstaking and patient process and relies more  on his intuition, eye and ability to play with light and exposure to capture  the interest of the observer.</p>
              <p>Jeff feels it important to  carefully observe our environment and seek out the potential beauty in the  world that lies just below the surface of our common perceptions.</p>
              <p>His latest collection Rustic  Landscapes is a case in point. The raw imagery presented in these works takes  every observer of the work to a different place relative to their own  perceptions. One of the greatest thrills of the work for Jeff is to hear where  the imaginations of those enjoying the work lead to. Whether they spark images  of other planetary landscapes, a pool of water with floating rose petals or  creatures from the deep realms of our minds, the work succeeds in sparking  inspiration from a very common and otherwise disregarded farm object that  caught his interested while visiting luvin’ lavender farm. One of Jeff’s  favorite moments is when he reveals what they really are.</p>
            <p>These and other works are available  in his online fine art gallery at           <a href="http://www.jeffjonesphotography.com">www.jeffjonesphotography.com</a></p></th>

            <h4 align="left">My first camera was a Brownie Hawkeye.<br />
              …..it set me upon my creative adventure.</h4>
            <h4 align="left"><br />
              I am a freelance photographer working in portraiture and fine art. My background is in watercolor, drawing, graphic design, and writing children's books. I studied photography, art and design at Lakeland Community College and watercolor with watercolor artist, Layne Kendig. I participate in the Gates Mills and the Annual Fairmount Art Exhibition art shows. My published works include photographs taken for Tamron Lens marketing materials, and two children's books written and illustrated: “The Princesses Gown” and “Oh Brothers, Stuff and Stories”.<br />
              <br />
              My photographic style is, “Sideways”.<br />
              …. as my fellow artists say.<br />
              <br />
              I photograph to document and celebrate life. A moment in time held up for all to see. As the artist behind the camera, I shoot and process my photographs using all of todays digital tools. I direct the focus with selective color or turn down the light to whisper a moment. I present the photograph in its best light…..small changes, big impact.<br />
              <br />
              An easy walk down this creative path often leads me to the creation of digital art. A place where there are no limits or pre-defined formulas that determine the final result. Unexpected.<br />

He began learning photography in the early 1970s in an  effort to share his view of that world with others. His photographic subjects  progressed from plants and insects to landscapes of the American Southwest in  the early 1980s. During the next 10 years Dean photographed landscapes  throughout North America. By the early 1990s Dean's photographic interests grew  to include the wildlife inhabiting the places he had come to know and love.  Since then Dean has photographed both landscapes and wildlife across North  America in addition to doing work in Southeast Asia and Australia.<br />
Dean's work was first published in the United States in  1986. His images have since been published in more than twenty-five countries  distributed across Europe, North America, and South Asia. His clients have  included the Audubon Society, Sierra Club, Susan G. Komen Foundation, the  United Nations, and the U.S. National Park Service. In 2004 Dean was recognized  by Asian Photography Magazine (India) in a special wildlife edition for  “courage and determination in making our planet a better place”.<br />
Dean has printed his own work since 1997. This allows him to  maintain a consistent visual interpretation from the first eyewitness view in  the field all the way to the finished print. Because photographic images  realize their maximum potential only in printed form, Dean expends a great deal  of time and effort refining these prints using the most advanced tools and techniques  available.<br />

He currently utilizes primarily digital technology, however still  maintaining an interest in the analog “old fashion” imagery, which he will on  occasion create.<br />
He has participated in numerous juried art and photographic  shows, and has most recently  curated  individual exhibits of his works for the Art Gallery of  the Porter Public Library in Westalke and  the Art Gallery of the Gathering Place in Bay  Village. Marcello was also featured , along with other local artists, in “Cast  Shadows”, at the Dianne Boldman Gallery of BayArts in Bay Village. Two of his  waterscapes have recently been included in the permanent Art collection of  Southwest General Hospital in Berea.<br />
His imagery is displayed at several local galleries and  shops; last year “ IMAGES”, a Photographic Art Gallery run by M. Mellino  successfully opened in Lakewood. The Gallery is located at 1414 Riverside Dr.,  suite # 208, and it is open primarily by appointment, and for periodic  exhibits.
