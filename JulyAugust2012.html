            </h2>
            <p align="left">    At present, Lisa Schonberg teaches  printmaking, and design courses as an adjunct professor at Notre Dame College  in S. Euclid, Ohio and Baldwin Wallace College in Berea, Ohio.  Lisa earned a BFA from Ohio University in  1976 majoring in Art Education and an MFA from Kent State University in 1984  majoring in Printmaking.  In addition to  teaching at Notre Dame and BW, Lisa has taught at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland  Institute of Art, the Orange Art Center and Zygote Press in Cleveland.  She has also taught in several  artist-in-residency programs such as Metro Health Center’s Art Therapy  Department, Laurel High School, Hawken Lower School and Moreland Hills  Elementary School.  Her teaching career  spans a total of 33 years.<br />
              As an artist, Lisa uses several  printmaking techniques such as etching, relief printing and monoprinting and  combines them with an excitement for the natural world.  Imaginary and stylized forms such as trees  and foliage, birds and other creatures are layered to produce one-of-a-kind  prints. This kind of subject matter is sometimes autobiographical and narrative  in content and relates to phases in her life as well as to natural phenomena  that sparks her interest. <br />
              The  prints Lisa makes are called <strong>monotypes  or monoprints</strong>.  Essentially a monotype  is made by applying ink in various ways to an unaltered, non-porous printing  plate such as a sheet of clear acrylic plastic or a metal plate. After the ink  has been manipulated on the plate, paper is then placed overtop the plate and  run through a printing press to obtain the image.  Sometimes the same print is run through the  press numerous times using different plates to create layering and several  variable images.  Unlike traditional  printmaking where multiples of identical prints can be produced, monoprinting  produces images that are all different and have the potential to reveal  exciting variations on a theme.  <br />
              Lisa’s work has been exhibited regionally  in various galleries, schools and museums since 1982.  This past winter, Lisa’s work was exhibited at  Zygote Press in Cleveland in an exhibit called “Intersections”, a collaborative  exhibition between Zygote and the LIT pairing image and poetry.  In the fall of ’09, 12 of her “bird” monotypes  were exhibited with 4 other Cleveland artists in Dresden, Germany in an exhibit  called “NEO5: Graphics from Zygote Press”.  Also, in ‘09, Lisa was awarded “Best in Show”  at the 38th annual Valley Arts Center Juried Exhibition in Chagrin  Falls, Ohio for a print titled “The Wisdom of Trees”.   In June  ‘06, Lisa was awarded the “Viktor Schreckengost Excellence in Design” Award at  the 35th Annual Gates Mills Juried Art Show for a monoprint titled  “Discourse and Intrusions”.  Also in  2006, Lisa was commissioned by the “University Print Club” of Cleveland to do  their annual edition.  She produced a  monoprint/woodcut titled “Tree Sounds”, a reaction to the mysteriousness of  nature and an expression of an alternate way of “looking” at the woods.  One of the prints from the edition of 18 is  now in the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Prints and Drawings  Department. <br />
              In addition, Lisa rents studio space at <strong>Zygote Press </strong>in Cleveland, Ohio where  she presently works making prints, teaching and volunteering.  216-956-3003 or <a href="mailto:adajul@aol.com">adajul@aol.com</a></p>
