        <p>One thing that I have learned from my art is that it is a  lifelong learning process, that leads me on an ever changing path.  It provides a really enjoyable outlet, where  hours fly by so quickly. And the people I have met while creating always seem  to be the nicest people. <br />
After art school, where I had the chance to try a variety of  mediums, I settled on for awhile, and became mostly preoccupied with  monoprints, which Gerry Gill turned me on to. That passion was followed by  several years of Sculpture and working in bronze at night school classes at the  Cleveland Institute. But the pieces were cumbersome and the finishing was a  lengthy ordeal. Next I tried a smaller form of sculpture with jewelry casting.  Eventually I met Dorothy Claflin who in  20 years of classes inspired me with pastels  and portraiture. And Lou Grasso later guided me in that pursuit.<br />
 When I started living  in Florida  for half the year, I started to become more interested in trying landscapes. I  started to experiment with oils and water colors and my interest in painting  Plein Air started to develop. <br />
I have had an opportunity to take some great workshops with  some fine artists including  Gerry Gill,  Judy Carducci, Anne Abgott, Douglas David, Walter Matia,  and Albert Handell. But probably the greatest  push comes from my studio mates who continually teach and inspire me.  <br />
So, while the road is ever changing, the constant is that there  is still so much more to learn. And I look forward to the challenge whenever  possible. </p></th>

          <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
          <p><strong>SUSAN ALLEN </strong>is an  accomplished musician with a Bachelor’s Degree in French Horn Performance from  The Cleveland Institute of Music.  She  was a member of the Canton and Youngstown Symphonies and was Principal Horn of  the Suburban Symphony Orchestra of Beachwood, Ohio, for twenty-seven  years.  She has performed with The  Cleveland Orchestra as a member of The Kent Blossom Festival and toured with  Bernadette Peters and Olivia Newton-John.   Ms. Allen retired from music in 2012 to actively pursue her interests in  the studio arts.  She has studied  drawing, watercolor, and oil painting with many artists in the Cleveland area,  including Tom Denny, Dino Massaroni, and John Carlson.  She is passionate about capturing in oil the  many beautiful and varied landscapes that she photographs while traveling.  Ms. Allen lives in Bratenahl, Ohio, with her  husband, Tom, and their Golden Retriever, Piper.</p>

          <p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
          <p>“I am inspired by the many beautiful landscapes I encounter  on my daily walks and travel adventures.   Because my background is classical music, my approach is thoughtful and  studied.  I capture what I see in a  realistic manner.  However, I see myself  moving toward a more interpretive painting style as time progresses.”<br />

          <p>Trained as an elementary  school teacher, I’ve always included adult art classes in my schedule wherever  I’ve lived. &nbsp;At this point, oil painting, primarily inspired by nature, is  what I most enjoy. &nbsp;Each painting is a learning experience and my hope is  to allow fresh ideas and methods to evolve in my work. </p>

          <p>    <a name="_GoBack" id="_GoBack2"></a>&nbsp;My art interests began in the 6th grade  when I took summer painting classes. In high school we had a very  talented&nbsp;instructor who painted in the classroom with us and taught the  basic principles of art, design and composition. Through 4 years of college in  Erie, Pennsylvania I studied with a skilled portrait painter working&nbsp;in  oil and pastel mediums. <br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I  have an undergraduate degree in Fine Art and a Master’s Degree in Art History,  and taught Art History at 3 different colleges before and after marrying. With occasional classes and workshops my appreciation and  creativity have increased and continued to enrich my life. <br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many  teachers and associates have helped me along the way and I honor the gifts they  have given me.</p></th>

        My interest and time for art  met when my 5 children were all in school. I  have taken classes through the years and my enthusiasm continues to  increase.I'm especially fond of nature, landscape  and   animals;but also enjoy still life and portraiture ! I have been  fortunate to have traveled extensively and influenced by foreign cultures,  their people and wildlife. My paintings are in a number of private homes in  U.S. I've been recognized locally with honorable  mentions and best in show. I have also  exhibited through invitationals  in NYC,  Newport Beach and  at the Rue Taine  Invitational   in Paris.            I hope you  enjoy my work, Mary Page -Williams   440-227-6863</p></th>
